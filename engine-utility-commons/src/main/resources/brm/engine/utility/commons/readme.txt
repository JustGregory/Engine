The 'engine-utility-commons' module.
====================================
  This module is a dependency which most other engine modules will use. It provides common declarations for simplifying
and unifying many common operations, as well as utility or "helper" activities.

  This is the match to the platform's baseline-commons module, doing for the engine components what that does for that.
