  This path is for the audio resources; it contains subdirectories for background musics, sound effects, music effects,
plus other audio purposes.

  Background music is typically any kind of musical track that may play and repeat continuously, or until another music
has been chosen. A track may be as short or as long as necessary; however, many typical track lengths are around two or
fewer minutes.

  Sound effects

  Music effects are single-instance musical themes for special circumstances; they may be used for the "game over", the
"battle won" or "battle lost" music, or other special game-instances.

  Other sound types may be for vocals (if spoken dialogue is part of the game), or other specialization in game audio.
